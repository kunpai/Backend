A Voltorb would have to use an electric-type attack to generate electricity. The only move it could do at this point to generate electricity would be Thunderbolt. We are not picking Thunder as it learns it at level 37, and evolves into Electrode at 30, and over-levelled Pokémon are assumed to not be found in the wild[5]. 

According to the official Japanese translation of Thunderbolt, 100,000 Volts[3], we can assume that the move generates 100,000 volts per use. Since its PP is 15, a Voltorb can generate 1,500,000 volts before needing rest. 1.5 million volts is about 2.4 * 10<sup>-13</sup> J in energy (using V = E/Q, where Q is 1.6 * 10<sup>-19</sup> C)[1]. Assuming one attack of Thunderbolt takes 1 second, power generated would be 2.4 * 10-13 W, and multiplying by 3600 seconds for one hour, gives us an energy usage of 8.64 * 10<sup>-10</sup> Wh or 8.64 * 10<sup>-13</sup> kWh.

Since the Hisui region is ancient Sinnoh, which is based on the real-life location of Hokkaido[4] in Japan, we find that the average Japanese uses 7499 kWh[2] per year. Dividing that by 365, we get around 20.5 kWh per day. 

Dividing the two values, we get around 2.37 * 10<sup>13</sup> Voltorb, which is not feasible, given the low number of Voltorb and the storage problems associated with so many Voltorb, not to mention the costs of infrastructure to heal the Voltorb after having exhausted their PP.

Assumptions:
1. Thunderbolt has an accurate voltage of 100000 volts.
2. 1 Thunderbolt per second.
3. Over-levelled Pokemon are not found in the wild.
4. Energy Ball is not a viable move to generate electricity. 
5. Hisui has the average yearly usage of current Japanese.
6. Hisui follows the rules of physics in our Universe, meaning it has the same constants like Q = 1.6 * 10-19 C.
